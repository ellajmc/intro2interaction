          The University of Canberra Student Residences were designed by John
          Andrews in 1973, for the Canberra College of Advanced Education
          (CCAE), construction being completed in 1975. The CCAE became the
          University of Canberra in 1990. They can be accessed from the
          University of Canberra campus off College Street or viewed from Aikman
          Drive, Bruce.
        </p>

        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <p>
          The residences are listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian
          Institute of Architects RAIA Register of Significant Twentieth Century
          Architecture. In July 2008 they were provisionally added to the ACT
          Heritage Register.
        </p>

        <p>
          The buildings are a rare residential example of the late twentieth
          century brutalist style with their strong shapes, boldly composed in
          off-form reinforced concrete and diagonal orientation with the strong
          curved element of the roof. With their planning over five levels and
          roof following the slope of the north facing site, they also display
          characteristics of the late twentieth century Sydney regional style.
          The group represents the ideal of innovative modern architecture and
          planning—clean, functional and well sited.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group is a relatively rare and well-preserved example of 1970s
          student accommodation. They are one of only two examples of on campus
          student residential accommodation designed by John Andrews in
          Canberra, one of Australia’s internationally acclaimed architects of
          the latter half of the twentieth century. The construction of off-form
          in situ concrete was also innovative for its time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The buildings have significance for their association with the
          development of tertiary education in Canberra during the 1970s, in
          particular for the provision of housing for large numbers of students
          in the early 1970s as a result of the introduction of free tertiary
          education by the Whitlam Labor Government.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
          Built on a north facing hillside, the group faces north and overlooks
          the College Park with its plantation of eucalypts and casuarinas and
          is framed by well-established native woodland. The complex consists of
          156 student study/bedrooms set out on a 3.05m square grid, arranged in
          six tiers of five levels, which follow the natural slope of the site.
          There is approximately a two-metre change in floor level between each
          unit as they step down the site, a climb of 13 rises to the
          street/stairway, while there is a small step down in floor level
          across the whole residence from the east to the west. Each tier is
          connected by an access stairway and the interlocking, staggered layout
          provides all rooms with a north-east orientation. The rooms are
          arranged in groups of six, with common lounge, dining, cooking and
          bathroom facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design represented a new type of planning for on campus student
          accommodation called studenentheim, where modules comprising six
          student rooms were linked with a separate sitting room, kitchen area
          and shared toilet facilities. This was an ideal use for John Andrews’
          additive style of architecture, where the basic building element of
          the student rooms is grouped around the shared facilities. The success
          of this studenentheim was such that the ANU then built Toad Hall
          following these principles, also using John Andrews as the architect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most internal walls are masonry, with the end wall to the wet areas
          painted externally. All external surfaces are off-form concrete except
          for the painted masonry walls to the rear entries and the bull-nosed
          corrugated roof. The concrete surfaces and roofing material combine to
          provide a uniform effect to the construction and visual character of
          the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          The residences are described in Canberra: An Architectural Guide to
          Australia’s Capital, RAIA ACT Chapter, 1982:
        </p>
        <p>
          Ground slope and diagonal orientation have been used to give character
          to both forms and spaces. Curved fascias and internal/street stairways
          which provide separate entrance to each cluster of bedrooms are
          noteworthy.

        <h3>John Andrews</h3>
        <p>
          John Andrews was born in Sydney in 1933 and graduated from the
          University of Sydney in 1956. In 1957 he entered the Masters of
          Architecture program at Harvard University. After graduating Andrews
          worked in Toronto until 1962, when he established John Andrews
          Architects in Toronto. He returned to Sydney in 1972, renaming the
          company John Andrews International.
        </p>
        <p>
          John Andrews is a key practitioner of the late twentieth century
          brutalist and late twentieth century late modern styles. His key
          buildings in Australia are the Cameron Offices and the American
          Express Tower, Sydney (1976).
        </p>
        <p>
          John Andrews designed other student residences in North America and
          two in Canberra: these and Toad Hall at the Australian National
          University.
